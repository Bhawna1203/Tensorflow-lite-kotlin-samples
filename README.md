# TensorflowLite Examples Kotlin

This repo contains the kotlin implementation of TensorflowLite Example Apps [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples), which are mostly implemented in java rightnow.
So if you like to see the kotlin, you can go through the repo!

## Goals
 - [ ] Adding all pre-existing example apps to the repo
 - [ ] Designing & Creating other apps using the new [Task API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/task_library/overview)
 - [ ] Designing & Creating example apps with the [Interpreter](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/lite_support), to show the implementation.
